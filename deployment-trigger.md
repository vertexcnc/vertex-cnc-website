# CLOUDFLARE DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER

Timestamp: 2025-09-04 00:10:30

This file is created to trigger a new Cloudflare Pages deployment with the correct repository structure.

Repository structure is now fixed:
- ✅ package.json in root directory
- ✅ src/ directory in root
- ✅ vite.config.js in root
- ✅ All project files properly structured

Cloudflare should now be able to find package.json and build successfully.
