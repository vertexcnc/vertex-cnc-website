# 🚨 CLOUDFLARE BUILD SETTINGS - FIX REQUIRED

## ❌ Current Settings (WRONG):
```
Build command: npm run build ✅ (Correct)
Build output directory: /dist ❌ (Wrong - has slash)
Build system version: 3 ✅ (Correct)  
Root directory: / ❌ (Wrong - should be empty)
```

## ✅ CORRECT SETTINGS:

### Build & Deploy Settings:
```
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: dist (NO SLASH at start!)
Build system version: 3 (latest)
Root directory: (LEAVE COMPLETELY EMPTY!)
```

### Environment Variables:
```
API_URL = https://vertex-cnc-production.vertex-cnc.workers.dev ✅
NODE_ENV = production ✅  
VITE_SITE_URL = https://vertexcnc.pages.dev ✅
```

## 🔧 HOW TO FIX:

### Step 1: Go to Settings
1. Cloudflare Pages dashboard'da projenizi açın
2. **"Settings"** tab'ına tıklayın
3. **"Builds & deployments"** bölümüne gidin

### Step 2: Fix Build Settings
1. **Root directory**: 
   - Current: `/` 
   - **Change to**: (completely empty - delete the `/`)
   
2. **Build output directory**:
   - Current: `/dist`
   - **Change to**: `dist` (remove the `/` at start)

3. **Keep these the same**:
   - Build command: `npm run build` ✅
   - Build system version: `3` ✅

### Step 3: Save Changes
1. **"Save"** butonuna tıklayın
2. Settings kaydedildikten sonra **"Retry deployment"** yapın

## 🎯 Why This Fixes the Issue:

### Root Directory Problem:
- `/` means "use root of repository" 
- But Cloudflare interprets this as "look in subfolder /"
- **Empty** means "use the actual repository root"

### Output Directory Problem:  
- `/dist` means "absolute path /dist"
- `dist` means "relative path dist/" (correct)

## 🚀 After Fixing:

Build log should show:
```bash
✅ Cloning repository...
✅ Using repository root (no subdirectory)
✅ Found package.json in root
✅ npm install
✅ npm run build  
✅ Build output to dist/
✅ Deploy successful
```

**Action**: Fix these 2 settings and retry deployment! 🎯
